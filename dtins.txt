arithmatic:
	12: general	regbyte mode:
		00: add
		01: sub
		02: mul
		03: integer division
		04: remainder
		05: bit shift right
		06: bit shift left
		07: and
		08: or
		09: xor
		0A: not (ignores regbyte)
		0B: inc

conditional:
	13: cmpreg	regbyte regbyte
	14: cmpimm	regbyte 8-bit-imm
	15: test	mode 00: if condition fails, increments the isp by 3 (skipping the next instruction)
		00: less than
		01: greater than
		02: less than or equal to
		03: greater than or equal to
		04: equal to
		05: not equal

jump:
	16: jmprimm	16-bit-imm (1s compliment)
	17: jmprreg	regbyte imm (0=for, otherwise back)
	18: jmpimm	16-bit-imm
	19: jmpreg	regbyte 00

stack:
	1A: pushreg	regbyte 00
	1B: pushimm	16-bit-imm
	1C: pop		regbyte 00
	1D: call	16-bit-imm (address to call)
	1E: ret		0000
	

Interrupts:
	Interupt timing based on memory address ff04-ff05
	If 0, 33ms/int is used
	Otherwise MEMADDRms/int is used (to allow for between 1000fps to 0.0153fps)
	First, the screen memory is used to update what is on the screen
	Next, the controller values are copied into ram
	Then the interrupt is handled
	If bytes ff02 and ff03 are 0, interrupt is ignored
	Otherwise, the current adress is pushed to the stack, and control is jumped to the value stored in bytes ff02 and ff03

Memory Map:
	Little Endian
	Values ff00-ffff are memory mapped hardware
	Reads and writes are undefined behaviour, except from:
	byte ff00-ff001 contains the 8 buttons on the controller
	bytes ff02-ff03 interrupts
	bytes ff04-ff05 interupt timing
	byte ff06-ffC5 contains the screen
	Imm 0yy, 0xzz represents 0xzzyy (little endian)
